This theme is derived from one of the default layouts included in
[Material-Kit-BS4](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-bs4/)
[adapted for Hugo templating by cboettig](https://github.com/cboettig/hugo-material-theme/)
and further adapted (colour changes) for CodeMeta by cboettig.

In late 2025, the site was stripped of most of Material-Kit-BS4, the css
& main material-kit.js (no plugins) being all that remains. Its 
Bootstrap and JQuery are now vanilla, and drop-in upgradable to later
versions.
